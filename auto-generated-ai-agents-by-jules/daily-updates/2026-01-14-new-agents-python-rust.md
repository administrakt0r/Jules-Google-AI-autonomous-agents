# Daily Update: 2026-01-14

## New Agents Created

### 1. Pythia (PYTHON) 🐍
- **Specialty**: Python optimization, type safety, and security.
- **Focus**: PEP 8 compliance, Pydantic data validation, Asyncio performance, and Bandit security scans.
- **Goal**: To modernize legacy Python codebases and ensure type safety.

### 2. Ferris (RUST) 🦀
- **Specialty**: Rust memory safety, performance, and idiomatic code.
- **Focus**: Clippy linting, unsafe block management, zero-cost abstractions, and compile time reduction.
- **Goal**: To ensure memory safety and maximize performance in systems programming.

## Repository Enhancements

- **Validation Workflow**: Updated `.github/workflows/agents-test.yml` to include the new agents in the test matrix.
- **Stricter Checks**: Added a requirement for the `## Daily Process` section in all agent definitions to ensure consistency.
- **Emoji Support**: Added validation for Python (🐍) and Rust (🦀) emojis.
- **Documentation**: Updated `README.md` with new agent guides, deep dives, and updated agent count (23).

## Next Steps

- Monitor adoption of new agents.
- Consider adding more language-specific agents (e.g., Go, Java) in future cycles.
- Explore further enhancements to the validation script (e.g., checking for specific markdown headers).
