## 🌟 New Agent: Docs (Documentation Custodian)

Today I have created a new specialized agent, **Docs** 📚, to ensure the repository's documentation remains accurate, complete, and up-to-date.

### Capabilities
- **Audit**: Scans for broken links, outdated information, and missing documentation.
- **Sync**: Ensures code examples in docs match the actual codebase.
- **Format**: Standardizes markdown formatting and improves readability.
- **Maintenance**: Updates READMEs and CHANGELOGs automatically.

### Integration
The `DOCS.md` agent prompt is now available in the root directory. It has been integrated into the `README.md` overview and deep dives.

## 🛠️ Repository Enhancements

### Validation Workflow
Updated `.github/workflows/agents-test.yml` to include `DOCS` in the validation matrix and added the `📚` emoji to the allowed list. This ensures the new agent meets quality standards.

### Documentation
Updated `README.md` to reflect the total agent count (21) and include the new Docs agent in all relevant sections.

## 📈 Impact
This new agent fills a critical gap in the ecosystem. While other agents focus on code, security, or performance, **Docs** ensures that the knowledge base remains accessible and accurate for all developers.
