# Daily Update: 2026-01-13

## 🚀 Summary of Changes

Today, I significantly expanded the repository's capabilities by adding 6 new specialized agents and enhancing 3 existing ones. The total agent count has increased to 16 (including Jules).

### 🆕 New Agents

I created the following agents to address gaps identified in the "High Priority" list:

1.  **DATABASE** 🗄️: Focuses on query optimization, schema design, and data integrity.
2.  **CICD** 🔄: Streamlines build pipelines, caching strategies, and automation reliability.
3.  **MONITORING** 📊: Enhances system observability through structured logging and alerting.
4.  **API** 🔌: Enforces API consistency, security, and documentation standards.
5.  **MOBILE** 📱: Optimizes React Native application performance and UX.
6.  **TESTING** 🧪: Improves test coverage, reliability, and execution speed.

### ✨ Enhancements

1.  **SENTINEL** 🛡️: Added detection for Zero-day vulnerabilities and Supply Chain attacks. improved API security checks.
2.  **BOLT** ⚡: Updated performance strategies to include Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, INP) and P99 backend latency optimization.
3.  **BUDDHA** 🧘: Enhanced GEO capabilities with Citation readiness, Vector search structuring, and FactCheck schema.

### 🛠️ Repository Maintenance

- Updated `README.md` with new agent descriptions and "Deep Dive" sections.
- Updated `.github/workflows/agents-test.yml` to validate the new agents and support their emojis.
- Created a local validation script `validate_agents.sh` to ensure quality standards are met before committing.

## 📈 Impact

These additions provide comprehensive coverage for the entire software development lifecycle, from Database design (DATABASE) to API development (API), Mobile implementation (MOBILE), Testing (TESTING), Deployment (CICD), and Monitoring (MONITORING).

## ⏭️ Next Steps

- Monitor usage and feedback for the new agents.
- Begin research on emerging technology agents (WEB3, AI/ML).
- Implement performance metrics tracking across all agents.
