# Daily Update: 2026-01-14

## New Agent Created
- **PYTHON** (🐍): Python optimization, PEP 8 compliance, type hinting, and dependency management agent.

## Actions Taken
- Created `PYTHON.md` Agent with comprehensive static type hinting (mypy/pyright), PEP 8 formatting (Black, Ruff, or Flake8 integration), efficient data structures (dict, set, generators), and secure dependency management priority areas.
- Formatted `PYTHON.md` to perfectly match the updated structure for Agents, adhering to all 5 Daily Process phases, Boundaries (Always, Ask, Never), Priority Areas, and Common Patterns.
- Updated `README.md` to list the new `PYTHON` agent.
- Logged changes in `.jules/jules-progress.md`.
